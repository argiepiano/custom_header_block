CUSTOM HEADER BLOCKS MODULE
=================

This module provides alternative configurations for site header components. 
- Site logo
- Site name
- Site slogan

The logo and site name are displayed inline (Site name to right of Logo, or a 
flipped configuration with Site name to left), and with the site slogan either 
or above the two inline components.
Alternatively the default header arrangement can be used. However, this module 
does not display the Account menu. This can of course be added as a separate 
block.


Installation
------------
1. Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at 
https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

2. Add the header block to your Layout.

3. Configure the header block and choose and save the desired configuration.
